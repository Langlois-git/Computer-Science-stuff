# Lambda Expressions - A function that takes x and returns f(g(x))
# Lambda Expressions are expressions that evaluate to functions

square = lambda x: x*x #This creates a function named square that will compute x * x

(lambda x: x*x)(10) #This will evaluate 10 * 10 as a call expression so it will be 100

"""A function with formal parameter x that returns x * x"""

#lambds expressions have no return keyword, this limits us to a sungle expresiion in the body of the lambda expression

# Only def statemnts provide functions an intrinsic name
